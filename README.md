# top-notes-collection

This is my collection of notes that I am taking while I am going through The Odin Project. I decided to create a website that displays these notes as practice
and as a testing grounds for new concepts that I will be learning. Hopefully these notes will be of use to someone if they ever decide to use them.

If you wanna check out the site so far:
