TODO:

figure out how to parse a odt file.
Use the data from the parse and input into html.
Either that, or display directly from txt.
Google to see if i can display odt files directly or through a pdf.

Make the cards interactable.

Make the theme selector work.

Add Logo

Preferably, make the cards change the html file and display different cards
rather than having to go to a different webpage
